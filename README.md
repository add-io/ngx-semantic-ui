# Semantic UI extension into Angular 2
This project is meant to remove JQuery from Semantic-UI's modules and build it in Angular 2.  The first portion of this project is meant
to take the existing structures of Semantic-UI where you could copy and paste their examples into your code and the set of directives/components
in this module will pick them up and create interactivity with them.

## Warning
This project is still in heavy development.  So there will be features that have not been implemented.

## Installation
```bash
npm install --save ngx-semantic-ui

cd {SEMANTIC FOLDER}
gulp build
```

## Use
After installation you will need to import the module into your angular project.
```typescript
// app.component.ts
import { Component, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    template:
`<select class="ui dropdown" [(ngModel)]='selectValue' allowReselection="true">
    <option value="">{{title}}</option>
    <option value="1">Male</option>
    <option value="0">Female</option>
</select>`
})
export class AppComponent {
    title = 'Placeholder Text';
}

// app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";
import { HttpModule } from "@angular/http";
import { NgxSemanticUiModule } from "ngx-semantic-ui";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        FormsModule,
        HttpModule,
        NgxSemanticUiModule
    ],
    declarations: [
        AppComponent,
    ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
